# minigma
Minigma is the java-optimised version of Minigma, using the BouncyCastle OpenPGP libraries.
Use Minigma on the server-side or whenever Java rather than Android is needed.
Use Minigmand with Android. The two projects *should* be in lockstep synch with each other, the only difference being the 
naming of the BouncyCastle packages.
